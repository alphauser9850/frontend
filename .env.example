# =============================
# Client-side (VITE_*) variables
# These are embedded into the client bundle. Do NOT put secrets here.
# =============================

# Supabase project URL (from Supabase settings)
# Used by the web app to connect to Supabase from the browser.
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url

# Supabase anon public key (from Supabase settings)
# Public, safe for client. Required for Supabase JS client.
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# PayPal client ID for client-side SDK initialization
# Used by the PayPal button on the frontend
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id

# Calendly scheduling link shown in the UI (full URL)
# Example: https://calendly.com/your-org/30min
VITE_CLENDELY_ID=https://calendly.com/your-org/30min

# Stripe publishable key used by the client SDK
# NOTE: The current code reads a misspelled variable name below.
# Keep this until the code is refactored to a correct name.
VITE_STRPE_PUBLIHED_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key

# (Optional/Legacy) Suggested correct name for future refactor
# Not currently used by the codebase; add for clarity only.
# VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key


# =============================
# Server-only variables (DO NOT prefix with VITE_)
# Loaded in Node (see server/env.js). Keep these SECRET.
# =============================

# HubSpot Private App Token (server-side API calls)
HUBSPOT_TOKEN=your-hubspot-private-app-token

PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-paypal-client-secret

# Brevo (Sendinblue) API key for emails (server-side)
BREVO_KEY=your-brevo-api-key

# Stripe secret key (server-side only)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key

# (Legacy/Not used by code) A server var seen on the server, but
# the client should use the VITE_ publishable key above instead.
# Keeping here for awareness. Safe to remove if unused in your deployment.
STRIPE_PUBLISH_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key


# =============================
# Notes
# - Client variables MUST start with VITE_.
# - Never expose server secrets with VITE_.
# - Duplicates in your current .env can be removed; keep one canonical value.
# - Known typo kept for compatibility: VITE_STRPE_PUBLIHED_KEY.
#   Plan to rename in code to VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and update here.
